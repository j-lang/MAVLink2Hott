# MAVLink2Hott
Interface for Ardupilot (Pixhawk, APM ...) to Graupner HoTT receiver to deliver Ardupilot telemetry data to Graupner transmitter.

Interface supports output of telemetry data but no modification of APM parameters via textmode.

Follow Wiki (https://github.com/j-lang/MAVLink2Hott/wiki) for setup.

Current version is under development. 
Stream from Mavlink to HoTT is currently working but only the following functions 
- Flight mode output 
- GPS satellites number
- GPS fix type
- GPS coordinates
